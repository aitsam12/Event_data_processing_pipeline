# Event Data Processing Pipeline
Welcome to the official repository of the Event Data Processing Pipeline! This hub is dedicated to converting event data from one format to another, streamlining your data processing tasks. Whether you're dealing with a single file or a batch, this repository provides the necessary tools and access to a wealth of open-source datasets.

# EventConversion_pipeline
The EventConversion_pipeline folder is equipped with Python scripts specifically designed for event data conversion between various formats.

## How to Use:
To utilize a conversion script, you need to provide the paths for the input file and the desired output file.
Once the paths are specified, the script automatically processes the data, ensuring the converted file is saved to your designated location.
